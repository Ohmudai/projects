          <h1>ABOUT:</h1>
          <h3>
            I am Om Kumar Shah, a passionate and driven computer science
            engineering student from the Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Engineering,
            Bangalore. With a strong foundation in programming languages like
            HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, and Java, I have developed expertise in
            areas such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Data
            Analysis. My technical proficiency is complemented by hands-on
            experience in projects like diabetes prediction, house price
            forecasting, and big sales data prediction using machine learning
            techniques. These projects have honed my problem-solving skills and
            allowed me to achieve high prediction accuracy rates. I am also
            proficient in working with tools like Google Colab and have a solid
            understanding of computer networks and operating systems.
            Additionally, my strong communication, time management, and leadership
            abilities have enabled me to excel in both team-based projects and
            individual tasks. My interest in continuous learning is reflected in
            my certifications in machine learning, data science, and Python
            programming. In my spare time, I have volunteered with NGOs,
            demonstrating my commitment to social responsibility. I am always
            eager to apply my skills in challenging environments and look forward
            to contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry.
